## Introduction

[In previous examples](overdispersed_splitting.html), the prior on $b$ is estimated to be a point mass.

This is because the `ebnm` was not able to find having more than one component useful.

Is $g\sim\delta_\theta$ a local optimal? Probably not.

In theory when $g(b)$ is a point mass then the ELBO of mean field splitting and the one with marginal $f(\mu;g,\sigma^2)$ are equivalent. But this does not mean $g(b)$ must be a point mass to maximize the elbo.
