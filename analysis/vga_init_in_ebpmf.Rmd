## Introduction

In some cases the data vector is very sparse. I investigate the performance of vga in this case.

The mean is fixed to -4, which is typically the case in single cell data. 

```{r}
library(vebpm)
n = 3000
y = c(rep(1,14),rep(0,n-14))
```

```{r}
fit = ebpm_normal(y,1,g_init=list(mean=-4,var=NULL),fix_g=c(T,F),return_sigma2_trace = T,tol=1e-8,maxiter = 10000)
plot(log10(fit$sigma2_trace),fit$obj_trace,xlab='log10(sigma2)',ylab='elbo',type='l',lwd=2,col=2)
```

The optimal variance in this case seems to converge to 0, but we don't want that for initialization in PMF.

We can also see that the elbo is flat when sigma2 is small.
